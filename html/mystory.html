      Yep. This is me. I've got a lot of ups and downs, lefts and rights.
      Admittedly, more ups than downs (but don't ask me to make a vertical buritto, because that's definitely the wrong vertical direction).
      More lefts than rights (queue being on the left side of the globe and the political spectrum).
